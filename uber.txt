Hello ${PERSON_NAME},

First of all, I would like to apologize for annoying you today with this email but this is my last resort to try to get my account fixed. In the past months, I have exhaustively tried to reach out to customer service but at one point they basically decided to ignore me.

Long story short, around February of 2019 my account mysteriously started get blocked. I contacted customer service and they were very helpful at first but the issue kept recurring. Slowing, Customer Service started to ignore my email/messages and I would just get the automated reply saying that the "responsible team" was looking into it but nothing else would happen. After months of walking in circles, I began to get very frustrated and, in some occasions, I even lost my temper and was rude in some of my messages, and for that I apologize. At the peak of my frustration, I even tried to have my account closed but not even that customer service was willing to do.

So, after trying everything in my power and being ignored, I decided to scrape LinkedIn for Uber employees both in Brazil and in the US in hopes that someone somewhere in the company could help me reestablish my account that was unjustly disabled without any warning or explanation. If you are willing to help me get my account back, my account info is under “rafaelcgama@gmail.com”.

Thanks for your time and have a great day,

Rafael
